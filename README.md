This is my personal web site, which is just a copy of my resume. I started with [Resume theme from Start Bootstrap][1] and jekyll-ified it a bit so it's DRY.  Feel free to fork it and do your own github.io resume.

If you're looking for someone who can "jekyll-ify some Bootstrap", contact me via [the site][the_site]. I'm available for work.
